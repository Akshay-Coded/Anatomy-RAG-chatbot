  <i>Built using RAG + FAISS + BioBERT + Groq LLaMA3</i>
</p>


Anatomical GPT is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot that answers **medical/anatomy-related queries** using trusted textbook PDFs like *Gray’s Anatomy*, *Sobotta*, and *Clinically Oriented Anatomy*. It uses **BioBERT for embeddings** and **Groq-hosted LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3)** for ultra-fast inference.

## 🔍 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a powerful technique that enhances large language models by combining:

- 📚 **Retrieval**: It first searches a document store (like medical textbooks in our case) to fetch relevant content.
- 🧠 **Generation**: It then uses a language model (such as LLaMA 3 or Mixtral via Groq) to generate accurate, informed, and context-aware answers using the retrieved content.

## 🚀 How RAG Powers Anatomical GPT

In **Anatomical GPT**, RAG enables the chatbot to:

- 🔎 **Access up-to-date medical knowledge** from detailed anatomy textbooks instead of relying solely on the model's internal knowledge.
- 📖 **Answer complex medical/anatomy questions** with high relevance and factual grounding.
- ✅ **Reduce hallucinations** by only generating answers based on trusted retrieved documents.
- ⚡ **Work efficiently** using Groq-hosted models for low-latency response times.

This makes the chatbot far more reliable for users seeking detailed anatomical insights — combining the best of retrieval and generation to support real-world medical queries.

## 📚 Books Used for Medical Knowledge Base

The chatbot uses content from the following comprehensive and authoritative anatomy textbooks:

| Book Title | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Clinically Oriented Anatomy** <br> *by Keith L. Moore* | A widely used anatomy textbook that bridges the gap between basic anatomy and clinical practice. It emphasizes the relevance of anatomy to clinical medicine and includes case studies and illustrations. |
| **Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice** | A classic and detailed reference in human anatomy, often considered the gold standard. It covers anatomical structures with clinical relevance, dissection guidance, and illustrations. |
| **Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy – Volume 1 & 2** | These volumes provide detailed anatomical illustrations and concise explanations. Volume 1 focuses on the head, neck, and neuroanatomy, while Volume 2 covers the thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and limbs. Ideal for medical students preparing for exams and clinical practice. |


## 🔄 Workflow Algorithm: Anatomical GPT

This section outlines the step-by-step flow that powers the RAG-based Anatomical GPT chatbot.

---

### 🧩 Step 1: Load and Process PDFs

1. **Input**: Medical textbooks in PDF format (e.g., Gray’s Anatomy, Sobotta, Clinically Oriented Anatomy).
2. **Loader**: Use `PyPDFLoader` (from LangChain) to extract text from each page.
3. **Storage**: All text is collected into `Document` objects.

---

### ✂️ Step 2: Chunking the Text

1. **Splitter**: Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to divide long documents into manageable ~500-token chunks.
2. **Overlap**: Maintain a chunk overlap (e.g., 100 tokens) to preserve context between adjacent chunks.
3. **Output**: A list of small, coherent text chunks ready for embedding.

---

### 🧠 Step 3: Create Embeddings and Store Vectors

1. **Embedding Model**: Use `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` with a biomedical model (e.g., BioBERT).
2. **Vector Store**: Store embeddings using `FAISS` for fast retrieval.
3. **Persistence**: Save FAISS index to disk for reuse without re-embedding.

---

### 🔍 Step 4: RAG-based Query Answering

1. **Retriever**: When a user asks a question, relevant text chunks are retrieved from FAISS using vector similarity.
2. **LLM**: The retrieved context is passed to a Groq-hosted model (e.g., LLaMA 3 or Mixtral).
3. **Answer Generation**: The model generates a grounded answer using both the prompt and retrieved context.

---

### 🖥️ Step 5: Streamlit Chat UI

1. **Input**: User enters medical/anatomy question.
2. **Backend Call**: Streamlit sends the question to the RAG pipeline.
3. **Display**: Answer is shown in the interface, along with optional source documents for transparency.
